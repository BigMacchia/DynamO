INSTALLATION
------------

Please see a full tutorial on the DynamO website. A quick summary is:

     make

And the executables will be installed into the bin directory. If you
want to install the executables to /usr/bin, run

     make install

Please pay attention to the output of the make command, as this scans
for required dependencies and will warn you if it is unable to build
DynamO!

SOURCE CODE

All of the source code is in the src/ directory. For more information
on the source code please see the src/README file. Also take a look at
the doxygen documentation (next section of this README).
