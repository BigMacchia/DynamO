*** INSTALLATION

 Please see a full tutorial on the DynamO website. A quick summary is
 # make
 Then, as the root user run
 # make install 

 Please pay attention to the output of the make command, as this scans
 for required dependencies and will warn you if it is unable to build
 DynamO!

*** SOURCE CODE

 All of the source code is in the src/ directory. For more information
 on the source code please see the src/README file. Also take a look
 at the doxygen documentation (next section of this README).

*** DOCUMENTATION
 
 Some resources are in the docs/ directory; however, the bulk of the
 documentation will be available on the website or in the forum.

 If you want the latest, up to date doxygen documentation, just run
 # doxygen
 in the same directory as this README. This will generate HTML
 docmentation in the docs/html directory.
