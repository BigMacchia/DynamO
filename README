DynamO:- A general event-driven particle simulator. Please see the
website below for more information.

INSTALLATION
------------

Please see tutorial 1 on the DynamO website for a full description on
how to build DynamO. A quick summary is:

     make

And the executables will be installed into the bin directory. If you
want to install the executables to /usr/bin, run

     make install

Please pay attention to the output of the make commands, as this scans
for required dependencies and will warn you if it is unable to build
DynamO! You may need to log in as root for the "make install" command
to work.

SOURCE CODE
-----------

All of the source code is inside the src/ directory. For more
information on the source code please see the src/README file. Also
take a look at the doxygen documentation (next section of this
README).

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
 
Some resources are in the docs/ directory; however, the bulk of the
documentation will be available on the website.

If you want the latest, up-to-date code doxygen documentation, just
run

     doxygen

in the same directory as this README. This will generate HTML
docmentation in the docs/html directory.

TESTING
-------

There is a test script in test/test_dynarun.sh which will run through
some sample simulations and halt if the results are wrong or if the
simulation fails.

You can also run some unit tests on the math libraries and OpenCL code
by running

     make test
