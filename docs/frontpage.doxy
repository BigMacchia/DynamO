/*! \mainpage DYNAMO source code documentation
 *
 * The C++ code consists of several programs
 * - dynarun (mdrun.cpp) - The Simulator itself, runs trajectories and collects %data
 * -  dynamod (configmod.cpp) - The configuration editor/generator
 *
 * To start browsing the sources, it might be best to start at the
 * main() function in mdrun.cpp and branch out from there.
 *
 * Alternatively, try the CSimulation::runSimulation() to see what a single simulation does.
