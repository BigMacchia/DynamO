* Code improvements
** Version Milestones
*** Dynamo 1.1
**** DONE Optimize the MinMax Heap memory usage to remove the wasted element.
**** DONE New properties framework.
**** DONE Migrate to RapidXML parser.
**** DONE Benchmark binary XML mode and text mode to see if binary is still required.
**** DONE Auto detect if outputted files should be compressed based off their extension.
**** DONE Add a multi-value property for Polydispersity.
**** DONE Change HardCoreDiam() to be ExcludedVolume in Interactions
**** TODO Fix Coil renderer to visualize polydisperse particles.
**** TODO Fix getInternalEnergy() in Interactions to work for polydispersity
**** TODO Remove the d2 argument to the smoothspherecoll (and any other run event functions)
**** TODO Move aspect ratio into BC class and fix that the units class calculates the box size.
**** TODO Volume Renderer
     - [X] Move to OpenCL generation of the gradients from live data
     - [X] Implement volume renderer
     - [X] Make a transfer function interface
     - [ ] Load the density data from some particles
**** TODO Merge orientation and normal liouvillean
**** TODO Improve the documentation
**** TODO Generalize the Morton ordered neighbour list
**** TODO Think about the unit rescale in compression, what happens with energy scales? do the velocities rescale?
**** TODO Stepped potential will not work for static & dynamic particle collisions, if an inner collision occurs an escape may occur earlier
*** Dynamo 1.2
**** TODO Generalized scheduler for multiple neighborlists
**** TODO Triangular Meshes
** Major Changes
*** Optimise the insertion of locals into neighbour lists
    - [ ] Cylinders can be inserted, just write the overlap test
    - [ ] Oscillating plates????
*** Coordinate Transformation Layer
    Write a transformation layer for the liouvillean which wraps the
    sim coordinates and allows simulations in arbitrary coordinate
    systems.
  - [ ] Mark or generalise the output plugins that cannot be used in
    the co-ordinate transform.
  - [ ] Make SLLOD coordinates work.
*** Multi dimensional sims
** Minor changes 
   - [ ] Make the sims run at a simulation temperature of 1 when in NVT ensemble
   - [-] Clean up the coordinator class
    - [X] Move the replex and standard runs into a class Engine
    - [ ] Split the replexer somehow and remove the ugly switch cases for speed
    - [ ] Add a Coordinator output plugin scheme
   - [ ] Compressibility <N^2>-<N>^2 for large HS sims
   - [-] Stop the use of pointers in output sims for the benefit of Replexing
    - [X] Add id numbers to every interaction
    - [-] Change the output plugins to use the id numbers and get rid of RTTI
** Done/Not needed 						       :ARCHIVE:
  - [X] Cells smaller than required plus overlinking may be quicker
    with lightweight transitions
  - [X] On cell update of the bounded queue check wether the local
    minimum changed, may be faster [[file:code/isss/schedulers/multlist.cpp][file,]] CELL EVENTS CHANGE LOCAL
    MINIMA
  - [X] Localise global events inside the scheduler - Done for multlist
  - [X] In compression dynamics, add the stream velocity on
    initialisation like SLLOD. NOT REALLY WHAT YOU WANT BOUNDARY CONDITIONS ARE INCORRECT
  - [X] Place Andersen walls thermostat inside the Liouvillean code where it belongs
  - [X] Make the Replexer engine automatically do the max collisions
  - [X] Experiment with the new vector class
  VECTOR COSTS ARE OPTIMISED AWAY ANYWAY with -O2
  - [-] Store inverse mass? will reduce alot of divides when
    calculating mu and delta p, NO POINT ITS THE MEMORY THAT'S SLOW
  - [-] Add autodetection of walls into geomview plugin NOT NEEDED POVRAY DOES THIS
  - [X] Play with the new boost accumulators and ring buffer
  - [X] Collision sentinel for low density sims
*** DONE Stepped potentials			:ARCHIVE:
    CLOSED: [2009-09-19 Sat 21:46]
    - [X] Make a generalised interface for captures, remove the hashed
      set to another class
    - [X] Implement a multistep hash bins
    - [X] Implement a stepped interaction potential
*** DONE Implement Parallel Hard Cubes		:ARCHIVE:
    CLOSED: [2009-06-10 Wed 07:58]
