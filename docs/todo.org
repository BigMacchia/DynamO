**** DONE DynamO: All particle positions are now shuffled for mixture systems in dynamod to enable faster equilibration.
**** DONE DynamO: Removed all deprecated Clone functions for copying of classes in the code.
**** DONE Coil: By default, spheres are ray-traced using geometry and fragment shaders to allow rendering of millions of perfectly spherical particles.

**** DONE *BUGFIX* Fixed the widespread improper use of the XML test functions, causing errors instead of warnings.
**** DONE *BUGFIX* DynamO: Fixed rare error caused by duplicate events in the queue, followed by a recalculation which indicates the event has numerically been cancelled, and the recalculated event is in the future.

**** DONE *BUGFIX* DynamO: Fixed stepped and sequenced potentials broken in 1.1.

**** DONE DynamO: Moved the dynamo code into its own folder in the src directory.
**** DONE DynamO: Removed the raster 3d output for the tinkerXYZ plugin, no-one used it anyway.

    sim coordinates and allows simulations in arbitrary coordinate
    systems.
  - [ ] Mark or generalise the output plugins that cannot be used in
    the co-ordinate transform.
  - [ ] Make SLLOD coordinates work.
