* Code improvements
** Version Milestones
*** DynamO 1.3
**** TODO Optimized triangle meshes by inserting them into the neighbor lists.
**** TODO Remove the cached particle data used in the collision detection. Migrate to the magnet libraries collision detection functions.
*** DynamO 1.2
**** DONE XML errors are now much more verbose and tell you exactly what went wrong and where.
**** DONE The DynamO-Coil integration can be forcibly enabled or disabled at build time.
**** DONE Initial support for triangular meshes. The current version is not optimized using a neighbor list.
**** DONE Implemented multicanonical simulations!
**** DONE Moved the dynamo code into its own folder in the src directory.
**** DONE Allow adjustable shear rates for the Lees-Edwards boundary condition.
**** DONE *BUGFIX* Fixed a load error on the MFT if the output configuration is from a simulation with no events.
**** DONE *BUGFIX* Fixed the build system failing when trying to build two variants at once.
**** DONE *BUGFIX* Fixed bounded priority queues causing huge slowdowns in small systems.
**** DONE Moved to a new console output formatting class.
**** DONE Removed the raster 3d output for the tinkerXYZ plugin.
**** DONE Added dynamod --check mode. Using this you can now check if a configuration file is valid (i.e., no overlaps).
**** TODO *Improvement* Rescaling thermostat for shear flows http://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.3704.
**** TODO Improve the way data is made available to Coil, allowing a paraview-like interface to the data sources.
**** TODO Coil library volume renderer (blocking on above)
     - [X] Move to OpenCL generation of the gradients from live data.
     - [X] Implement volume renderer.
     - [X] Make a transfer function interface.
**** TODO Generalized scheduler for multiple neighborlists.
**** TODO Generalize the Morton ordered neighbour list.
**** TODO Move all the dynamo classes into the dynamo namespace.
*** DynamO 1.1 							    :ARCHIVE:
**** DONE *MAJOR* Remove Unit types from the XML file and simulator.
**** DONE *MAJOR* Remove aspect ratio and instead load the primary image cell size.
**** DONE *MAJOR* Remove binary XML mode, new parser is fast enough and binary blobs are not XML.
**** DONE *MAJOR* Merged orientation and normal liouvillean.
**** DONE *MAJOR* Migrated to the RapidXML parser, cleaning up the XML loading code, reducing memory usage and speeding up loading of the config files.
**** DONE *MAJOR* New properties framework, allowing polydispersity and a very general way to attach values to particles.
**** DONE *MAJOR* New dynamod mode (-m 26) - Polydisperse Sheared Hard Spheres
**** DONE *MINOR* Optimize the MinMax Heap memory usage to remove a wasted element (5-10% memory saving).
**** DONE *MINOR* Auto detect if outputted files should be compressed based off their file extension.
**** DONE *MINOR* Removed the Geomview output plugin, the coil library supercedes these very old visualization plugins.
**** DONE *MINOR* Cleaned up dynamod's command line options and --help flag to make it more user friendly.
**** DONE *MINOR* Made it easier to take snapshots of the system, without using the ticker plugin.
**** DONE *BUG* Now both the length and time scales are rescaled after a compression. This holds the energy and velocity scales constant. Related: The new properties framework has fixed several errors in the original rescaling.
**** DONE *BUG* Stepped potentials now work for static-dynamic particle collisions.
**** DONE *BUG* Fixed the segfault when a simulation closes coil through a shutdown.
**** DONE *BUG* Fixed compression of shearing systems failing due to an incorrect rescaling of the box shift in the BC's.
**** DONE *BUG* Fixed render target not getting resized or initialised on old GPUs, breaking rendering in the Coil library.
**** DONE *API-CHANGE* Replace HardCoreDiam() with ExcludedVolume() in Interactions
**** DONE *API-CHANGE* Renamed and documented the CEnsemble class.
**** DONE Update the tutorials.
*** DynamO 1.0 							    :ARCHIVE:
    First major release of DynamO.
** Major Changes
*** Optimise the insertion of locals into neighbour lists
    - [ ] Cylinders can be inserted, just write the overlap test
    - [ ] Oscillating plates????
*** Coordinate Transformation Layer
    Write a transformation layer for the liouvillean which wraps the
    sim coordinates and allows simulations in arbitrary coordinate
    systems.
  - [ ] Mark or generalise the output plugins that cannot be used in
    the co-ordinate transform.
  - [ ] Make SLLOD coordinates work.
*** Multi dimensional sims
** Minor changes 
   - [ ] Make the sims run at a simulation temperature of 1 when in NVT ensemble
   - [-] Clean up the coordinator class
    - [X] Move the replex and standard runs into a class Engine
    - [ ] Split the replexer somehow and remove the ugly switch cases for speed
    - [ ] Add a Coordinator output plugin scheme
   - [ ] Compressibility <N^2>-<N>^2 for large HS sims
   - [-] Stop the use of pointers in output sims for the benefit of Replexing
    - [X] Add id numbers to every interaction
    - [-] Change the output plugins to use the id numbers and get rid of RTTI
** Done/Not needed 						       :ARCHIVE:
  - [X] Cells smaller than required plus overlinking may be quicker
    with lightweight transitions
  - [X] On cell update of the bounded queue check wether the local
    minimum changed, may be faster [[file:code/isss/schedulers/multlist.cpp][file,]] CELL EVENTS CHANGE LOCAL
    MINIMA
  - [X] Localise global events inside the scheduler - Done for multlist
  - [X] In compression dynamics, add the stream velocity on
    initialisation like SLLOD. NOT REALLY WHAT YOU WANT BOUNDARY CONDITIONS ARE INCORRECT
  - [X] Place Andersen walls thermostat inside the Liouvillean code where it belongs
  - [X] Make the Replexer engine automatically do the max collisions
  - [X] Experiment with the new vector class
  VECTOR COSTS ARE OPTIMISED AWAY ANYWAY with -O2
  - [-] Store inverse mass? will reduce alot of divides when
    calculating mu and delta p, NO POINT ITS THE MEMORY THAT'S SLOW
  - [-] Add autodetection of walls into geomview plugin NOT NEEDED POVRAY DOES THIS
  - [X] Play with the new boost accumulators and ring buffer
  - [X] Collision sentinel for low density sims
*** DONE Stepped potentials			:ARCHIVE:
    CLOSED: [2009-09-19 Sat 21:46]
    - [X] Make a generalised interface for captures, remove the hashed
      set to another class
    - [X] Implement a multistep hash bins
    - [X] Implement a stepped interaction potential
*** DONE Implement Parallel Hard Cubes		:ARCHIVE:
    CLOSED: [2009-06-10 Wed 07:58]
