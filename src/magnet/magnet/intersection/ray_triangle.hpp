    //! A ray-triangle intersection test.
    //!
    //! The method used is described in "Fast, minimum storage
    //! ray-triangle intersection", by Tomas MÃ¶ller and Ben Trumbore.
    //!
    //! Here we make the assumption that all positions are relative to
    //! the first vertex. Thus we only need to pass the two edge
    //! vectors of the triangle.
    //!
    //! For backface culling, we use counter-clockwise ordering of the
    //! vertices.
    //!
    //! \tparam BACKFACE_CULLING Ignores ray triangle intersections
    //! where the ray enters the back face of the triangle.

    //! \tparam DIAGONAL_TEST Enables one of the checks used to make
    //! sure the intersection point is within the triangle. This is
    //! turned off to implement other ray-shape intersection tests
    //! (\sa ray_quadrilateral). Defaults to enabled.
    //!
    //! \param T The origin of the ray relative to the first vertex.
    //! \param D The direction/velocity of the ray.
    //! \param E1 The first edge vector of the triangle (V1-V0).
    //! \param E2 The second edge vector of the triangle (V2-V0).
    //! \return The time until the intersection, or HUGE_VAL if no intersection.
